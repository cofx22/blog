            <p>Consider the following function, which</p><ul><li>takes a map of dependencies and a ring request,</li><li>updates a gift using data from the request, and</li><li>returns a ring response:</li></ul><!-- force end of list --><pre><code class="lang-clojure">&#40;defn update-gift &#91;{:keys &#91;datasource&#93;} request&#93;

</code></pre><p>The function <code>domain/update-gift!</code> persists the changes to the database. It has a side effect, which makes it an impure function. Because <code>update-gift</code> uses <code>domain/update-gift!</code>, it's impure too.</p><p>You could argue that this fact alone is a reason to refactor this code. Generally speaking, pure functions are easier to test and easier to reason about, which are both good reasons to prefer pure functions over impure ones.</p>

            <h1><a href="shadow-cljs-tests.html">shadow-cljs and running tests</a></h1>
            <p>When I used to work on front ends based on JavaScript or TypeScript, I usually had <a href='https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html'>Karma</a> running in watch mode while developing. Each time I saved a file, all (unit) tests would run. This would give me a short feedback loop, letting me know quickly when I was unintentionally breaking things and constantly indicating whether what I was creating matched its specifications as defined by the tests. In other words, tests were used to prevent regressions, but also as a tool to quickly see whether I was building the right things.</p><p>In the last few years, I've been using Clojure and ClojureScript to create prototypes and utilities at work as well as hobby projects and apps for personal use. Because of the size and nature of these applications, I wasn't too worried about regressions. Because Clojure and ClojureScript have excellent support for REPL-driven development, the need for tests as a means for quick feedback also disappeared. As a result, I wrote a few tests for these applications, but not nearly as many as I used to.</p><p>Deep down inside, however, I knew I would have to invest some time into learning more about testing Clojure and ClojureScript applications at some point. I wouldn't want to work in a team that produced software without decent test coverage. I should hold myself to the same standard. This week, I decided to sit down and take some time to look into different ways to execute tests for ClojureScript apps powered by <a href='https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs'>shadow-cljs</a>. As you may know, shadow-cljs is one of the two de facto standard tools for creating ClojureScript apps. The other is <a href='https://figwheel.org/'>Figwheel</a>.</p>

            <p><em>This post first appeared on <a href='https://www.kabisa.nl/tech/'>Kabisa's Tech Blog</a>.</em></p><p>In the previous installment of browser beats, we used the <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API'>Web Audio API</a> to synthesize a kick drum. This time, weâ€™ll look at snares and hi-hats. Once you know how to synthesize kicks, snares and hi-hats are not far away.</p>
